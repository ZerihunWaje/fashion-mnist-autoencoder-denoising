# Fashion MNIST Denoising Autoencoder

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an **autoencoder** neural network to **denoise** images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The Fashion MNIST dataset contains 28x28 grayscale images of clothing items like shirts, shoes, and bags.

The autoencoder learns to remove noise from corrupted images and reconstruct clean versions, which can be useful in image processing and computer vision tasks.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python 3.6+**: Main programming language.
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: For building and training the autoencoder model.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations and data handling.
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization of images and results.
- **Pandas**: (Optional) For any data manipulation or analysis.
- **VS Code / Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment for writing and running the code.

## Workflow

1. **Load Dataset**  
   Load the Fashion MNIST dataset using TensorFlow's built-in dataset loader.

2. **Preprocess Data**  
   Normalize pixel values and add artificial noise to create noisy inputs.

3. **Build Autoencoder Model**  
   Define the architecture using TensorFlow/Keras layers.

4. **Train Model**  
   Train the autoencoder on noisy images to learn how to reconstruct clean images.

5. **Evaluate and Visualize**  
   Test the model on noisy test images and visualize the denoised outputs.

6. **Save Model (Optional)**  
   Save the trained model for future use or deployment.

## Key Concepts
- Autoencoder: A neural network architecture designed to encode input data into a compressed representation and then decode it back to reconstruct the original input.

- Denoising Autoencoder: A variation that learns to remove noise from corrupted inputs.

- Fashion MNIST: A popular dataset of 28x28 grayscale images of 10 different fashion categories, commonly used for benchmarking image algorithms.
